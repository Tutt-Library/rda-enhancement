# Welcome to the Tutt Library RDA Enhancement for MARC21 Records

The Tutt Library has started to convert our AACR2 and prior MARC21 records following the 
[Program for Cooperative Catalog Post-Implementation Hybrid Bibliographic Records Guidelines Task Group][PPC_HYBRID]
recommendations. This project is first being used for the processing 245 records for the Springer EBooks job in the
internal branch of the [Aristotle Library Apps][ALA] project.

This code will be included as a submodule in Tutt Library's planned [Music Library Catalog Upgrade Project](https://github.com/Tutt-Library/music-library-catalog).
